                            to name only one, I moved from my initial proof of
                            concept, which was very naive and not scalable at
                            all, with every kind of code mixed (inputs, net
                            code, game logic, graphic code, etc.), to a more
                            scalable architecture, with a clear separation of
                            concerns. To summarize, clients synchronize their
                            clock with the server, they predict inputs and sent
                            them to the server. The server queue them, then
                            process the same physic simulation and update all
                            the clients at a specific network update rate. Then
                            the clients reconciliate the state, using what can
                            be describe as rollback net code. The server is
                            authoritative and own the truth. This is also made
                            to have in mind cheat protection at some point, to
                            allow a clean leader board, as the game seems to be
                            a good fit for speed runners.
